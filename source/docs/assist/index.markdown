Assist is our feature to allow you to control Home Assistant using natural language. It is built on top of an open voice foundation and powered by knowledge provided by our community. You can use the [built-in sentences](/docs/assist/builtin_sentences) to control entities and areas, or [create your own](/docs/assist/custom_sentences).

[List of supported languages.](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/voice/intent-recognition/supported-languages)

Assist is available to use on most platforms that can interface with Home Assistant. Look for the Assist icon <img src='/images/assist/assist-icon.svg' alt='Assist icon' style='height: 32px' class='no-shadow'>:
