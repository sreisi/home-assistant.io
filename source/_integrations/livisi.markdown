The LIVISI Smart Home integration allows you to connect your LIVISI Smart Home Controller (SHC) to Home Assistant. The SHC can control compatible devices from RWE/innogy connected to it.
 
The following devices are currently supported by this integration:
 
- Indoor Smart Plug (PSS)
- Outdoor Smart Plug (PSSO)
- Wall Switches (ISS, ISS2)
- Room Heating Control (VRCC) that includes support for physical heating devices such as RSTx, WRT, FSC8
 
## Prequisites
 
This integration communicates with the local version of LIVISI SmartHome only. 
 
To activate the local SmartHome functionality, please use the LIVISI App and go to **Settings** >> **General Settings** >> **Local SmartHome** and click **Activate**.
 
Please visit [LIVISI Community](https://community.livisi.de) for more information.

### Extra Configuration
 
The current integration will not find your SHC automatically and needs to be configured manually. You will need to provide the IP address and the local password for the controller.
 
## Device Discovery

All devices are automatically discovered and included by the integration. If you include a new device in LIVISI SmartHome, the device will automatically appear in Home Assistant after a few minutes.
