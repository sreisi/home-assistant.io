This is a sensor to collect information from your Growatt inverters using [Growatt server](https://server.growatt.com/) by default. It is possible to specify an alternative endpoint server at configuration time e.g., [SMTEN](https://server.smten.com/).

This will log into your Growatt account and grab the first "Plant", after which it collects the inverters on this plant and creates sensors for these inverters as well as total sensors.
