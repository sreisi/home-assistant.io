This integration allows you to control a Z-Wave network via the [Z-Wave JS](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/) driver.

To Run Z-Wave you will need a [Supported Z-Wave dongle](/docs/z-wave/controllers/#supported-z-wave-usb-sticks--hardware-modules), a running Z-Wave JS server (using only **one** of the add-ons or installation methods described below), and the Z-Wave integration.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

If you run Home Assistant Container, Home Assistant Core, or you don't want to use the built-in Z-Wave JS Server add-on, please see the [advanced installation instructions](#advanced-installation-instructions).

For new installations, network security keys will be automatically generated for you. If this Z-Wave stick has already been paired with secure devices, you need to enter the previously used network key as the S0 network key. S2 security keys will be automatically generated for you. Make sure that you keep a backup of these keys in a safe place in case you need to move your Z-Wave stick to another device.

<p class='note'>
While your Z-Wave mesh is permanently stored on your stick, the additional metadata is not. When the Z-Wave integration starts up the first time, it will interview your entire Z-Wave network. Depending on the number of devices paired with the Z-Wave stick, this can take a while. You can speed up this process by manually waking up your battery-powered devices. Most of the time this is a press on the button on those devices (see their manual). It is not necessary to exclude/re-include devices from the mesh.

## Services

### Service `zwave_js.set_config_parameter`

This service will update a configuration parameter. To update multiple partial parameters in a single call, use the `zwave_js.bulk_set_partial_config_parameters` service.

| Service Data Attribute 	| Required  	| Description                                                                                                                               	|
|------------------------	|-----------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `entity_id`            	| no        	| Entity (or list of entities) to set the configuration parameter on. At least one `entity_id`, `device_id`, or `area_id` must be provided.                       	|
| `device_id`            	| no        	| Device ID (or list of device IDs) to set the configuration parameter on. At least one `entity_id`, `device_id`, or `area_id` must be provided.                                                	|
| `area_id`            	  | no        	| Area ID (or list of area IDs) for devices/entities to set the configuration parameter on. At least one `entity_id`, `device_id`, or `area_id` must be provided.                                                	|
| `parameter`            	| yes       	| The parameter number or the name of the property. The name of the property is case sensitive.                                             	|
| `bitmask`              	| no        	| The bitmask for a partial parameter in hex (0xff) or decimal (255) format. If the name of the parameter is provided, this is not needed. 	|
| `value`                	| yes       	| The target value for the parameter as the integer value or the state label. The state label is case sensitive.                       	|

#### Examples of setting a single parameter value

Let's use parameter 31 for [this device](https://devices.zwave-js.io/?jumpTo=0x000c:0x0203:0x0001:0.0) as an example to show examples of different ways that the `LED 1 Blink Status (bottom)` partial parameter can be set. Note that in places where we are using different values for the same key, the different values are interchangeable across the examples. We can, for instance, use `1` or `Blink` interchangeably for the `value` in all of the examples.

Example 1:

```yaml
service: zwave_js.set_config_parameter
target:
  entity_id: switch.fan
data:
  parameter: 31
  bitmask: 0x01
  value: 1
```

Example 2:

```yaml
service: zwave_js.set_config_parameter
target:
  entity_id: switch.fan
data:
  parameter: 31
  bitmask: 1
  value: "Blink"
```

Example 3:

```yaml
service: zwave_js.set_config_parameter
target:
  entity_id: switch.fan
data:
  entity_id: switch.fan
  parameter: "LED 1 Blink Status (bottom)"
  value: "Blink"
```

### Service `zwave_js.bulk_set_partial_config_parameters`

This service will bulk set multiple partial configuration parameters. Be warned that correctly using this service requires advanced knowledge of Z-Wave to use correctly.

| Service Data Attribute 	| Required  	| Description                                                                                                                               	|
|------------------------	|-----------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `entity_id`            	| no        	| Entity (or list of entities) to bulk set partial configuration parameters on. At least one `entity_id`, `device_id`, or `area_id` must be provided.                       	|
| `device_id`            	| no        	| Device ID (or list of device IDs) to bulk set partial configuration parameters on. At least one `entity_id`, `device_id`, or `area_id` must be provided.                                                	|
| `area_id`            	  | no        	| Area ID (or list of area IDs) for devices/entities to bulk set partial configuration parameters on. At least one `entity_id`, `device_id`, or `area_id` must be provided.                                                	|
| `parameter`            	| yes       	| The parameter number of the property. The name of the property is case sensitive.                                             	|
| `value`                	| yes       	| Either the raw integer value that you want to set for the entire parameter, or a dictionary where the keys are either the bitmasks (in integer or hex form) or the partial parameter name and the values are the value you want to set on each partial (either the integer value or a named state when applicable). Note that when using a dictionary, and bitmasks that are not provided will be set to their currently cached values.                       	|

#### Examples of bulk setting partial parameter values

Let's use parameter 21 for [this device](https://devices.zwave-js.io/?jumpTo=0x031e:0x000a:0x0001:0.0) as an example to show how partial parameters can be bulk set. In this case, we want to set `0xff` to `127`, `0x7f00` to `10`, and `0x8000` to `1` (or the raw value of `4735`).

<div class='note'>

When using the dictionary format to map the partial parameter to values, the cached values for the missing partial parameters will be used. So in examples 2, 3, 4, and 5, the service would use the cached value for partial parameters `0xff0000`, `0x3f000000`, and `0x40000000` because new values haven't been specified. If you send the raw integer value, it is assumed that you have calculated the full value, so in example 1, partial parameters `0xff0000`, `0x3f000000`, and `0x40000000` would all be set to `0`.

</div>

Example 1:

```yaml
service: zwave_js.bulk_set_partial_config_parameters
target:
  entity_id: switch.fan
data:
  parameter: 21
  value: 4735
```

Example 2:

```yaml
service: zwave_js.bulk_set_partial_config_parameters
target:
  entity_id: switch.fan
data:
  parameter: 21
  value:
    0xff: 127
    0x7f00: 10
    0x8000: 1
```

Example 3:

```yaml
service: zwave_js.bulk_set_partial_config_parameters
target:
  entity_id: switch.fan
data:
  parameter: 21
  value:
    255: 127
    32512: 10
    32768: 1
```

Example 4:

```yaml
service: zwave_js.bulk_set_partial_config_parameters
target:
  entity_id: switch.fan
data:
  parameter: 21
  value:
    255: 127
    32512: 10
    32768: "Fine"
```

Example 5:

```yaml
service: zwave_js.bulk_set_partial_config_parameters
target:
  entity_id: switch.fan
data:
  parameter: 21
  value:
    "Quick Strip Effect: Hue Color Wheel / Color Temp": 127
    "Quick Strip Effect Intensity": 10
    "Quick Strip Effect Intensity Scale": "Fine"
```

### Service `zwave_js.refresh_value`

This service will refresh the value(s) for an entity. This service will generate extra traffic on your Z-Wave network and should be used sparingly. Updates from devices on battery may take some time to be received.

| Service Data Attribute 	| Required 	| Description                                                                                                                                      	|
|------------------------	|----------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `entity_id`            	| yes      	| Entity or list of entities to refresh values for.                                                                                                	|
| `refresh_all_values`   	| no       	| Whether all values should be refreshed. If  `false`, only the primary value will be refreshed. If  `true`, all watched values will be refreshed. 	|

### Service `zwave_js.set_value`

This service will set a value on a Z-Wave device. It is for advanced use cases where you need to modify the state of a node and can't do it using native Home Assistant entity functionality. Be warned that correctly using this service requires advanced knowledge of Z-Wave. The service provides minimal validation and blindly calls the Z-Wave JS API, so if you are having trouble using it, it is likely because you are providing an incorrect value somewhere. To set a config parameter, you should use the `zwave_js.set_config_parameter` or `zwave_js.bulk_set_partial_config_parameters` services instead of this one.

| Service Data Attribute 	| Required 	| Description                                                                                                                                      	|
|------------------------	|----------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `entity_id`            	| no        	| Entity (or list of entities) to set the value on. At least one `entity_id`, `device_id`, or `area_id` must be provided.                       	|
| `device_id`            	| no        	| Device ID (or list of device IDs) to set the value on. At least one `entity_id`, `device_id`, or `area_id` must be provided.                                                	|
| `area_id`            	  | no        	| Area ID (or list of area IDs) for devices/entities to set the value on. At least one `entity_id`, `device_id`, or `area_id` must be provided.                                                	|
| `command_class`       	| yes       	| ID of Command Class that you want to set the value for. 	                                                                                            |
| `property`            	| yes       	| ID of Property that you want to set the value for. 	                                                                                                  |
| `property_key`        	| no        	| ID of Property Key that you want to set the value for. 	                                                                                              |
| `endpoint`   	          | no        	| ID of Endpoint that you want to set the value for. 	                                                                                                  |

| `options`   	          | no        	| Set value options map. Refer to the Z-Wave JS documentation for more information on what options can be set. 	                                                                                                                |
| `wait_for_result`   	  | no        	| Boolean that indicates whether or not to wait for a response from the node. If not included in the payload, the integration will decide whether to wait or not. If set to `true`, note that the service call can take a while if setting a value on an asleep battery device. |

### Service `zwave_js.multicast_set_value`

This service will set a value on multiple Z-Wave devices using multicast. It is for advanced use cases where you need to set the same value on multiple nodes simultaneously. Be warned that correctly using this service requires advanced knowledge of Z-Wave. The service provides minimal validation beyond what is necessary to properly call the Z-Wave JS API, so if you are having trouble using it, it is likely because you are providing an incorrect value somewhere.

| Service Data Attribute 	| Required 	| Description                                                                                                                                      	|
|------------------------	|----------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `entity_id`            	| no        	| Entity (or list of entities) to set the value on via multicast. At least two `entity_id` or `device_id` must be resolved if not broadcasting the command.                       	|
| `device_id`            	| no        	| Device ID (or list of device IDs) to set the value on via multicast. At least two `entity_id` or `device_id` must be resolved if not broadcasting the command.                                                	|
| `area_id`            	  | no        	| Area ID (or list of area IDs) for devices/entities to set the value on via multicast. At least two `entity_id` or `device_id` must be resolved if not broadcasting the command.                                                	|
| `broadcast`             | no          | Boolean that indicates whether you want the message to be broadcast to all nodes on the network. If you have only one Z-Wave network configured, you do not need to provide a `device_id` or `entity_id` when this is set to true. When you have multiple Z-Wave networks configured, you MUST provide at least one `device_id` or `entity_id` so the service knows which network to target.                                         |
| `command_class`       	| yes       	| ID of Command Class that you want to set the value for. 	                                                                                            |
| `property`            	| yes       	| ID of Property that you want to set the value for. 	                                                                                                  |
| `property_key`        	| no        	| ID of Property Key that you want to set the value for. 	                                                                                              |
| `endpoint`   	          | no        	| ID of Endpoint that you want to set the value for. 	                                                                                                  |
| `value`   	            | yes        	| The new value that you want to set. 	                                                                                                                |
| `options`   	          | no        	| Set value options map. Refer to the Z-Wave JS documentation for more information on what options can be set. 	                                                                                                                |

### Service `zwave_js.invoke_cc_api`

Call this service to use the Command Class API directly. In most cases, the `zwave_js.set_value` service will accomplish what you need to, but some Command Classes have API commands that can't be accessed via that service. Refer to the [Z-Wave JS Command Class documentation](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/api/CCs/index) for the available APIs and arguments. Be sure to know what you are doing when calling this service.

If `endpoint` is specified, that endpoint will be used to make the CC API call for all devices, otherwise the primary value endpoint will be used for each entity.                      	|
| `device_id`            	| no        	| Device ID (or list of device IDs) to ping. At least one `entity_id`, `device_id`, or `area_id` must be provided. If `endpoint` is specified, that endpoint will be used to make the CC API call for all devices, otherwise the root endpoint (0) will be used for each device.                                               	|

### Service `zwave_js.ping`

> NOTE: This service has been deprecated and replaced with a new button entity. The service will still work for now but will be removed in a future release. Users are advised to move their automations to use the `button.press` service with the new entity which is a like for like replacement.

Calling this service forces Z-Wave JS to try to reach a node. This can be used to update the status of the node in the Z-Wave network when you think it doesn't accurately reflect reality, e.g. reviving a failed/dead node or marking the node as asleep.

| Service Data Attribute 	| Required 	| Description                                                                                                                                      	|
|------------------------	|----------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `entity_id`            	| no        	| Entity (or list of entities) to ping. At least one `entity_id`, `device_id`, or `area_id` must be provided.                       	|
| `device_id`            	| no        	| Device ID (or list of device IDs) to ping. At least one `entity_id`, `device_id`, or `area_id` must be provided.                                                	|
| `area_id`            	  | no        	| Area ID (or list of area IDs) for devices/entities to ping. At least one `entity_id`, `device_id`, or `area_id` must be provided.                                                	|

This service can be used in tandem with the node status sensor to track the node's status and fire the command when needed. Here's an example automation that would ping a node when the node status sensor state has changed to dead and remained dead for 30 minutes. Note that this may be useful for some devices but will definitely not be useful for all. In cases where it is not useful, all you will be doing is generating additional traffic on your Z-Wave network which could slow down communication.

```yaml
trigger:
  platform: state
  entity_id:
    - sensor.z_wave_thermostat_node_status
    - sensor.z_wave_lock_node_status
  to: "dead"
  for: "00:30:00"
action:
  - service: zwave_js.ping
    target:
      entity_id: "{{ trigger.entity_id }}"
```

## Events

There are two types of events that are fired, notification events and value notification events. You can test what events come in using the event {% my developer_events title="developer tools in Home Assistant" %} and subscribing to the `zwave_js_notification` or `zwave_js_value_notification` events respectively. Once you know what the event data looks like, you can use this to create automations.

### Node events (Notification)

Check the [Z-Wave JS notification event documentation](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/api/node?id=quotnotificationquot) for an explanation of the notification event data. These events fire with the `zwave_js_notification` event type.

Notification event data can be used to trigger automations, both in the automation UI and in YAML, using the event platform. Check the details of an event by subscribing to the zwave_js_notification event in the [Developers Tools](/docs/tools/dev-tools/#subscribe-to-an-event).

```yaml
# Fires whenever the lock is unlocked by the keypad.
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: zwave_js_notification
    event_data:
      node_id: 14
      event_label: "Keypad unlock operation"
```

#### Notification Command Class

These are notification events fired by devices using the Notification command class. The `parameters` attribute in the example below is optional, and when it is included, the keys in the attribute will vary depending on the event.

```json
{
    "domain": "zwave_js",
    "node_id": 1,
    "home_id": "974823419",
    "device_id": "ad8098fe80980974",
    "command_class": 113,
    "command_class_name": "Notification",
    "type": 6,
    "event": 5,
    "label": "Access Control",
    "event_label": "Keypad lock operation",
    "parameters": {"userId": 1}
}
```

#### Multilevel Switch Command Class

These are notification events fired by devices using the Multilevel Switch command class. There are events for start level change and stop level change. These would typically be used in a device like the Aeotec Nano Dimmer with an external switch to respond to long button presses.

##### Start Level Change
```json
{
    "domain": "zwave_js",
    "node_id": 1,
    "home_id": 974823419,
    "device_id": "2f44f0d4152be3123f7ad40cf3abd095",
    "command_class": 38,
    "command_class_name": "Multilevel Switch",
    "event_type": 4,
    "event_type_label": "label 1",
    "direction": "up"
},
```

##### Stop Level Change
```json
{
    "domain": "zwave_js",
    "node_id": 8,
    "home_id": 3803689189,
    "device_id": "2f44f0d4152be3123f7ad40cf3abd095",
    "command_class": 38,
    "command_class_name": "Multilevel Switch",
    "event_type": 5,
    "event_type_label": "label 2",
    "direction": null
},
```

#### Entry Control Command Class

These are notification events fired by devices using the Entry Control command class.

```json
{
    "domain": "zwave_js",
    "node_id": 1,
    "home_id": "974823419",
    "device_id": "ad8098fe80980974",
    "command_class": 111,
    "command_class_name": "Entry Control",
    "event_type": 6,
    "event_type_label": "label 1",
    "data_type": 5,
    "data_type_label": "label 2",
    "event_data": "555"
}
```

### Scene events (Value Notification)

Value Notifications are used for stateless values, like `Central Scenes` and `Scene Activation`. These events fire with the `zwave_js_value_notification` event type.

Value Notification example:

```json
{
    "domain": "zwave_js",
    "node_id": 1,
    "home_id": "974823419",
    "endpoint": 0,
    "device_id": "ad8098fe80980974",
    "command_class": 91,
    "command_class_name": "Central Scene",
    "label": "Event value",
    "property": "scene",
    "property_name": "scene",
    "property_key": "001",
    "property_key_name": "001",
    "value": "KeyPressed",
    "value_raw": 0
}
```

### Value updated events

Due to some devices not following the Z-Wave Specification, there are scenarios where a device will send a value update but a state change won't be detected in Home Assistant. To address the gap, the `zwave_js_value_updated` event can be listened to to capture any value updates that are received by an affected entity. This event is **enabled on a per device and per entity domain basis**, and the entities will have `assumed_state` set to `true`. This change will affect how the UI for these entities look; if you'd like the UI to match other entities of the same type where `assumed_state` is not set to `true`, you can override the setting via [entity customization](/docs/configuration/customizing-devices/#assumed_state).

The following devices currently support this event:

| Make            	| Model                            	| Entity Domain 	|
|-----------------	|----------------------------------	|---------------	|
| Vision Security 	| ZL7432 In Wall Dual Relay Switch 	| `switch`      	|

Value Updated example:

```json
{
    "node_id": 4,
    "home_id": "974823419",
    "device_id": "ad8098fe80980974",
    "entity_id": "switch.in_wall_dual_relay_switch",
    "command_class": 37,
    "command_class_name": "Switch Binary",
    "endpoint": 0,
    "property": "currentValue",
    "property_name": "currentValue",
    "property_key": null,
    "property_key_name": null,
    "value": 0,
    "value_raw": 0
}
```

This event can be used to trigger a refresh of values when the new state needs to be retrieved. Here's an example automation:

```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: zwave_js_value_updated
    event_data:
      entity_id: switch.in_wall_dual_relay_switch
action:
  - service: zwave_js.refresh_value
    data:
      entity_id:
        - switch.in_wall_dual_relay_switch_2
        - switch.in_wall_dual_relay_switch_3
```

## Automations

The `Z-Wave` integration provides its own trigger platforms which can be used in automations.

### `zwave_js.value_updated`

This trigger platform can be used to trigger automations on any Z-Wave JS value update, including Z-Wave JS values that aren't supported in Home Assistant via entities. While they can't be authored from the automation UI, they can be authored in YAML directly in your `configuration.yaml`.

#### Example automation trigger configuration

```yaml
# Fires whenever the `latchStatus` value changes from `closed` to `opened` on the three devices (devices will be derived from an entity ID).
trigger:
  platform: zwave_js.value_updated
  # At least one `device_id` or `entity_id` must be provided
  device_id: 45d7d3230dbb7441473ec883dab294d4  # Garage Door Lock device ID
  entity_id:
    - lock.front_lock
    - lock.back_door
  # `property` and `command_class` are required
  command_class: 98 # Door Lock CC
  property: "latchStatus"
  # `property_key` and `endpoint` are optional
  property_key: null
  endpoint: 0
  # `from` and `to` will both accept lists of values and the trigger will fire if the value update matches any of the listed values
  from:
    - "closed"
    - "jammed"
  to: "opened"
```

#### Available Trigger Data

In addition to the [standard automation trigger data](/docs/automation/templating/#all), the `zwave_js.value_updated` trigger platform has additional trigger data available for use.

| `trigger.current_value`      | The current value for this Z-Wave value (translated to a state name when possible).        |
| `trigger.current_value_raw`  | The raw current value for this Z-Wave value (the key of the state when a state is named).  |

### `zwave_js.event`

This trigger platform can be used to trigger automations on any Z-Wave JS controller, driver, or node event, including events that may not be handled by Home Assistant automatically. Refer to the linked [Z-Wave JS documentation](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/) to learn more about the available events and the data that is sent along with it.

There is strict validation in place based on all known event types, so if you come across an event type that isn't supported, please open a GitHub issue in the `home-assistant/core` repository.

#### Example automation trigger configuration

```yaml
# Fires whenever the `interview failed` event is fired on the three devices (devices will be derived from device and entity IDs).
trigger:
  platform: zwave_js.event
  # At least one `device_id` or `entity_id` must be provided for `node` events. For any other events, a `config_entry_id` needs to be provided.
  device_id: 45d7d3230dbb7441473ec883dab294d4  # Garage Door Lock device ID
  entity_id:
    - lock.front_lock
    - lock.back_door
  config_entry_id:
  # `event_source` and `event` are required
  event_source: node   # options are node, controller, and driver
  event: "interview failed"  # event names can be retrieved from the Z-Wave JS docs (see links above)
  # `event_data` and `partial_dict_match` are optional. If `event_data` isn't included, all events of a given type for the given context will trigger the automation. When the `interview failed` event is fired, all argument live in a dictionary within the `event_data` dictionary under the `args` key. The default behavior is to require a full match of the event_data dictionary below and the dictionary that is passed to the event. By setting `partial_dict_match` to true, Home Assistant will check if the isFinal argument is true and ignore any other values in the dictionary. If this setting was false, this trigger would never fire because the dictionary always contains more keys than `isFinal` so the comparsion check would never evaluate to true.
  event_data:
    args:
      isFinal: true
  partial_dict_match: true  # defaults to false
```

#### Available Trigger Data

In addition to the [standard automation trigger data](/docs/automation/templating/#all), the `zwave_js.event` trigger platform has additional trigger data available for use.

| Template variable            | Data                                                                                       |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `trigger.device_id`          | Device ID for the device in the device registry (only included for node events).                                           |
| `trigger.node_id`            | Z-Wave node ID (only included for node events).                                                                            |
| `trigger.event_source`      | Source of event (node, controller, or driver).                                                                          |

| `trigger.event_data`           | Any data included in the event.                                                                   |

## Advanced Features (UI Only)

While the integration aims to provide as much functionality as possible through existing Home Assistant constructs (entities, states, automations, services, etc.), there are some features that are only available through the UI.

All of these features can be accessed either in the Z-Wave integration configuration panel or in a Z-Wave device's device panel.

### Integration Configuration Panel

The following features can be accessed from the integration configuration panel:

- **Add device:** Allows you to pre-provision a SmartStart device or start the inclusion process for adding a new device to your network.
- **Remove device:** Starts the exclusion process for removing a device from your network.
- **Heal network:** Forces your network to rediscover routes to the controller from each device. This is useful when devices or the controller have moved to a new location, or if you are having significant problems with your network, but it also generates a lot of network traffic and should be used sparingly.
- **Third party data opt-in/out:** Allows you to opt-in or out of telemetry that the zwave-js project collects to help inform development decisions, influence manufacturers, etc. This telemetry is disabled by default and has to be opted in to be activated.
- **[Controller statistics](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/api/controller?id=quotstatistics-updatedquot):** Provides statistics about communication between the controller and other devices, allowing you to troubleshoot your network's RF quality.

### Device Panel

The following features can be accessed from the device panel of a Z-Wave device:

- **Configure:** Provides an easy way to look up and update configuration parameters for the device. While there is an existing service for setting configuration parameter values, this UI may sometimes be quicker to use for one off changes.
- **Re-interview:** Forces the device to go through the interview process again so that zwave-js can discover all of its capabilities. Can be helpful if you don't see all the expected entities for your device.
- **Heal:** Forces the device to rediscover its optimal route back to the controller. Use this if you think you are experiencing unexpected delays or RF issues with your device. Your device may be less responsive during this process.
- **Remove failed:** Forces the controller to remove the device from the controller. Can be used when a device has failed and it can't go through the normal exclusion process.
- **[Statistics](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/api/node?id=quotstatistics-updatedquot):** Provides statistics about communication between this device and the controller, allowing you to troubleshoot RF issues with the device.
- **Update firmware:** Updates a device's firmware using a manually uploaded firmware file. Only some devices support this feature (controllers and devices with the Firmware Update Metadata Command Class).

## Advanced installation instructions

If you are using Home Assistant Container, Home Assistant Core, or you don't want to use the built-in Z-Wave JS Server add-on, you will need to run the Z-Wave JS server yourself, to which the Z-Wave integration will connect.

### Running [Z-Wave JS Server](https://github.com/zwave-js/zwave-js-server).

This application provides the connection between your Z-Wave USB stick and Home Assistant. The Home Assistant Z-Wave integration connects to this server via a websocket connection. You need to run this Z-Wave JS server before you can use the integration.

There are multiple ways to run this server:

**Option 1: The official Z-Wave JS add-on, as described above**

_This option is only available for Home Assistant OS (the recommended installation type) and Home Assistant Supervised installations._

This add-on can only be configured via the built-in Z-Wave control panel in Home Assistant.

**Option 2: The Z-Wave JS UI add-on installed from the community add-on store**

_This option is only available for Home Assistant OS (the recommended installation type) and Home Assistant Supervised installations._

This add-on includes the Z-Wave JS Server as part of the Z-Wave JS UI application. The Z-Wave network can be configured via the built-in Z-Wave control panel in Home Assistant and alternatively via the Z-Wave control panel built into Z-Wave JS UI. It provides you with a full-fledged, attractive, and feature-complete UI to manage your Z-Wave nodes and settings, which may support more advanced use cases as development continues on the Z-Wave control panel.

**Option 3: The Z-Wave JS UI Docker container**

This is the recommended approach if you're running Home Assistant Container. See the [Z-Wave JS UI documentation](https://zwave-js.github.io/zwave-js-ui//#/getting-started/quick-start) for instructions.

This method provides the same server application and UI as the Z-Wave JS UI add-on. After installing the Docker image, make sure you enable the WS Server in the Home Assistant section of Settings page.

**Option 4: Run the Z-Wave JS server yourself**

This is considered a very advanced use case. In this case you run the Z-Wave JS Server or Z-Wave JS UI NodeJS application directly. Installation and maintaining this is out of scope for this document. See the [Z-Wave JS server](https://github.com/zwave-js/zwave-js-server) or [Z-Wave JS UI](https://github.com/zwave-js/zwave-js-ui/) GitHub repository for information.

[Supported Z-Wave dongle](/docs/z-wave/controllers/#supported-z-wave-usb-sticks--hardware-modules). The Z-Wave controller dongle should be connected to the same host as where the Z-Wave JS server is running. In the configuration for the Z-Wave JS server, you need to provide the path to this stick. It's recommended to use the `/dev/serial-by-id/yourdevice` version of the path to your stick, to make sure the path doesn't change over reboots. The most common known path is `/dev/serial/by-id/usb-0658_0200-if00`.

<div class='note info'>

**Network keys** are used to connect securely to compatible devices. The network keys consist of 32 hexadecimal characters, for example, `2232666D100F795E5BB17F0A1BB7A146` (do not use this one, pick a random one). Without network keys security enabled devices cannot be added securely and will not function correctly. You must provide these network keys in the configuration part of the Z-Wave JS Server.

For new installations, unique default keys will be auto-generated for you by the Z-Wave JS add-on. You can also generate those network keys in the Settings section of Z-Wave JS UI.

Make sure that you keep a backup of these keys in a safe place. You will need to enter the same keys to be able to access securely paired devices.

### Installing and configuring the Z-Wave integration in Home Assistant

Once you have the Z-Wave JS server up and running, you need to install and configure the integration in Home Assistant (as described above).

If you're running full Home Assistant with supervisor, you will be presented with a dialog that asks if you want to use the Z-Wave JS Supervisor add-on. You **must** uncheck this box if you are running the Z-Wave JS server in any manner other than the official Z-Wave JS add-on, including using Z-Wave JS UI add-on.

If you're not running the supervisor or you've unchecked the above-mentioned box, you will be asked to enter a websocket URL (defaults to ws://localhost:3000). It is very important that you fill in the correct (Docker) IP/hostname here. For example for the Z-Wave JS UI add-on this is `ws://a0d7b954-zwavejs2mqtt:3000`.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Supported Devices and Command Classes

See the [Z-Wave JS device database](https://devices.zwave-js.io/).

While there is support for the most common devices, some command classes are not yet (fully) implemented in Z-Wave JS. You can track the status [here](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/issues/6).

You can also keep track of the roadmap for the Z-Wave integration [here](https://github.com/home-assistant-libs/zwave-js-server-python/issues/56).

### Installation and Configuration

#### Which Z-Wave controller should I buy?

Z-Wave supports all known 500 and 700 series Z-Wave controllers. If you are just starting out, we recommend that you purchase a 700 series controller (with firmware updated to >=7.17.2).

For more information, see [Supported Z-Wave dongles](/docs/z-wave/controllers/#supported-z-wave-usb-sticks--hardware-modules)

#### Why was I (or why was I not) automatically prompted to install Z-Wave?

Some Z-Wave USB sticks can be auto-discovered, which can simplify the Z-Wave setup process. The following devices have been tested with discovery, and offer a quick setup experience; however, these are **not** all of the devices supported by Z-Wave:

| Device | Identifier | Vendor |
| -------| ---------- | ------ |
| Aeotec Z-Stick Gen5+ | 0658:0200 | https://aeotec.com/products/aeotec-z-stick-gen5/ |
| Nortek HUSBZB-1 | 10C4:8A2A | https://www.nortekcontrol.com/products/2gig/husbzb-1-gocontrol-quickstick-combo/ |
| Zooz ZST10 | 10C4:EA60 | https://www.getzooz.com/zooz-zst10-s2-stick/ |
| Z-WaveMe UZB | 0658:0200 | https://z-wave.me/products/uzb/ |

Additional devices may be discoverable, however only devices that have been confirmed discoverable are listed above.

#### What happened to Zwavejs2Mqtt or the Z-Wave JS to MQTT add-on?

Zwavejs2Mqtt was renamed Z-Wave JS UI in September 2022. They are synonymous with no difference between their capabilities.

#### Can I switch between the Official Z-Wave JS add-on and the Z-Wave JS UI add-on?

You can, but you cannot run them both at the same time. Only one of them can be active at the same time.

#### How do I switch between the Official Z-Wave JS add-on and the Z-Wave JS UI add-on?

Switching does not require renaming your devices.

1. Disable the Z-Wave integration. **Do not remove the Z-Wave integration or you will lose all device and entity naming.** This will automatically stop the official Z-Wave JS add-on.

2. Note your network security keys from the official add-on.

3. Install and configure the Z-Wave JS UI add-on, including setting the location of your Z-Wave device and the network security keys.

4. Add the Z-Wave integration again (even though it is still installed), and uncheck the "Use the Z-Wave JS Supervisor add-on". Enter the correct address for the community add-on in the URL field in the next step.

5. Uninstall the official Z-Wave JS add-on.

6. Enable the Z-Wave integration.

#### What's the benefit of using Z-Wave JS UI add-on over the official Add-On?

The official add-on provides the Z-Wave Server in its bare minimum variant, just enough to serve the Home Assistant integration.

The Z-Wave JS UI project includes the Z-Wave JS Server for convenience but also provides a Z-Wave Control panel and the ability to serve your Z-Wave network to MQTT. This allows you to use the control panel, and if you so choose, to also use MQTT at the same time. For example, some users may use MQTT to interact with Z-Wave from other devices, while the Home Assistant integration still works (as long as you keep the WS Server enabled in Z-Wave JS UI).

#### Z-Wave JS UI seems to provide discovery of Home Assistant devices on its own too, now I'm confused

Correct, the Z-Wave JS UI project existed before Home Assistant had plans to move to the Z-Wave JS Driver. You should use the integration for device discovery and _not_ the MQTT discovery provided by Z-Wave JS UI.

#### Can I run Z-Wave JS UI only for the control panel and nothing else?

Sure, in the settings of Z-Wave JS UI, make sure to enable "WS Server" and disable "Gateway".

#### Should I name my devices in Home Assistant, or in Z-Wave JS UI?

Ultimately, this is a personal decision. If you provide a name or location for a device in the Z-Wave JS UI, that name will be imported into Home Assistant when the integration is reloaded or Home Assistant is restarted. Any entity names, however, will not change if the device has already been set up by Home Assistant. Names set in Z-Wave JS UI _will not_ overwrite changes that have already been made in Home Assistant.

Names set in Home Assistant will not import into Z-Wave JS UI.

### Using Z-Wave

#### How can I add (include) a new device to my Z-Wave network?

1. In Home Assistant: open Settings -> Devices & Services -> Z-Wave -> Configure.
2. Press `+ ADD DEVICE`.
3. The Z-Wave controller is now in inclusion mode and will not respond to other commands.
4. Put the device you want to add in inclusion mode. Refer to its manual how this is done.
5. The UI should confirm that the node was added and it will be immediately visible in Home Assistant. After a short while (seconds to minutes) the entities should also be created.
6. If the controller fails to add/find your device, cancel the inclusion process (to unblock your network again). In some cases it might help to first remove a node (exclusion) before you add it, even when the device has not been added to this Z-Wave network yet. Another approach would be to factory reset the device. Info about that is in the manual of your device.

If your device is included using S2 security, you may be prompted to enter a PIN number provided with your device. Often, this PIN is provided with the documentation _and_ is also printed on the device itself.

**Warning:**

1. **Do not move your Z-Wave stick to include devices.** This is no longer necessary and leads to broken routes.
2. **Do not initiate device inclusion from the Z-Wave stick itself.** This is no longer supported.

#### Should I use `Secure Inclusion`?

That depends. There are two generations of Z-Wave security, S0, and S2.

S0 security imposes significant additional traffic on your mesh and is recommended only for devices that require security, such as door locks.

S2 security does not impose additional network traffic and provides additional benefits, such as detecting packet corruption. By default, Z-Wave attempts S2 security during inclusion if supported, falling back to S0 security only when necessary.

#### How do I remove (exclude) a device from my Z-Wave network?

1. In Home Assistant: open Settings -> Devices & Services -> Z-Wave -> Configure.
2. Press `REMOVE DEVICE`.
3. Press `START EXCLUSION`. The Z-Wave controller is now in exclusion mode and will not respond to other commands.
4. Put the device you want to remove in exclusion mode. Refer to its manual how this is done.
5. The UI should confirm that the node was removed and the device and entities will be removed from Home Assistant.

### Troubleshooting

#### I'm having a problem, what should I do first?

_Many_ reported issues result from RF interference caused by the system's USB ports. This can manifest in many ways, including devices that won't include at all, devices that won't include securely, sensors with erroneous values (packets corrupted), delayed control of devices, or no ability to control devices.

**All users are encouraged to use a USB extension cable to prevent such interference.** Please try such a cable before opening an issue or requesting support on Discord. It will nearly always be the first troubleshooting step that we ask you to take anyway.

After ensuring you are using an extension cable, perform a network heal.

The combination of these two steps corrects a large number of reported difficulties.

#### I have an Aeotec Gen5 controller, and it isn't detected on my Raspberry Pi 4?

The first-generation Gen5 controller has a known bug when plugged into a Pi 4 and possibly other systems. Aeotec released the Gen5+ stick to correct this bug. Gen5 users can plug their sticks into a USB 2.0 hub in order to overcome the issue.

#### I do not see any entities created for my device in Home Assistant

Entities will be created only after the node is ready (the interview is completed). Also, note that some devices (like button remotes) do not create any entities but will only provide events when a button is pressed. See the events section on how to handle those events in your automations.

If you are certain that your device should have entities and you do not see them (even after a restart of Home Assistant Core), create an issue about your problem on the GitHub issue tracker.

#### My device does not automatically update its status in HA if I control it manually

Your device might not send automatic status updates to the controller. While the best advice would be to update to recent Z-Wave Plus devices, there is a workaround with active polling (request the status).

Z-Wave does not automatically poll devices on a regular basis. Polling can quickly lead to network congestion and should be used very sparingly and only where necessary.

- We provide a `zwave_js.refresh_value` service to allow you to manually poll a value, for example from an automation that only polls a device when there is motion in that same room. If you **really** need polling, you can enable this in Z-Wave JS UI but not in the official add-on.

- Z-Wave JS UI allows you to configure scheduled polling on a per-value basis, which you can use to keep certain values updated. It also allows you to poll individual values on-demand from your automations, which should be preferred over blindly polling all the time if possible.

<div class='note warning'>
Polling should only be used as a last resort. You must use it with care and accept the negative impact on your network. Z-Wave is a very low speed network and poll requests can easily flood your network and slow down your commands.
</div>

#### My device is recognized as Unknown Manufacturer and/or some of its functionalities do not work with the Z-Wave integration

When your device is not yet fully interviewed, this info will not yet be present. So make sure your device is interviewed at least once.

If the interview is complete, then the device does not yet have a device file for Z-Wave JS. Unlike other Z-Wave drivers, your device may very well work as intended even without such a file. If your device not fully supported, consider [contributing the device configuration file](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/config-files/contributing-files).

#### How do I get a dump of the current network state?

When trying to determine why something isn't working as you expect, or when reporting an issue with the integration, it is helpful to know what Z-Wave JS sees as the current state of your Z-Wave network. To get a dump of your current network state, follow the menu:

{% my integrations title="**Settings** -> **Devices & Services**" %} -> **Z-Wave** -> **...** -> **Download diagnostics**

### Interference issues

Many users have reported issues with interference when the USB stick was directly connected to the machine (proximity). If you are having issues try to use a short USB 2.0 A male to female extension cord.

#### How to access the Z-Wave logs

Z-Wave JS writes details to its logs. To access these logs go to the following.

   **Settings** -> **Devices & Services** -> **Integrations(tab)** -> **Z-Wave (CONFIGURE)** -> **Logs(tab)**

You need to keep this browser tab open for logging to be active.
